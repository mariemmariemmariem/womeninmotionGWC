However, in recent years, there has been a decline in the representation of women in coaching roles. In 2009, women held only 21% of all head coaching positions in intercollegiate sports for both men and women's teams, and the percentage increased slightly to 43% for head coaching positions in women's teams specifically (Miller & Flores, 2011). This downward trend in women's representation in coaching positions is concerning and requires attention.<br><br>The statistics further highlight the gender disparities in coaching positions. For example, in the Women's Basketball Division I 2007-2008 season, black women occupied only 10.7% of the head coaching positions, indicating additional challenges faced by women of color in securing coaching opportunities (Borland & Bruening, 2010). In terms of assistant coaching positions, black women comprised 16.1% of the positions, while white women held 47.9% (Borland & Bruening, 2010).

This lack of access to sports programs limits girls' opportunities for participation and engagement in sports activities. Safety concerns also play a role, as girls may face challenges in accessing safe facilities or transportation to sports venues, particularly in dense urban environments.<br> <br> Social stigma surrounding girls' involvement in sports can lead to bullying, social isolation, and negative performance evaluations. These experiences may discourage girls from participating in sports and contribute to their dropout rates. The quality of the sports experience also affects girls' continued engagement, with disparities observed in facilities, coaching, equipment, and uniforms between boys' and girls' programs .This discrepancy can undermine the enjoyment and sense of inclusion in sports for girls.<br><br>  Cost is another significant factor influencing girls' participation in sports.
